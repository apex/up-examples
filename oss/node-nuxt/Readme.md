# Node Nuxt

Nuxt.js application.

> :warning: **Important:** This example will only work with a [custom domain](https://up.docs.apex.sh/#configuration.stages_custom_domains) or an Up [vanity URL](https://github.com/apex/up/issues/179).

## Setup

```
$ yarn
```

## Deploy

```
$ up
```

## Notes

The `.upignore` file contains `!.nuxt` to include the `./.nuxt` build directory. This is necessary because `.gitignore`'d files and dotfiles (or dirs) are ignored by default.
