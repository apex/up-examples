## Up Examples

Example applications, APIs, and sites for [Up](https://github.com/apex/up), organized by plan:

- [OSS](oss) – open-source edition.
- [Pro](pro) – commercial edition.

For real-world open source example applications visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/apex/up/wiki#applications).

## Notes

- Each example has a Readme.md with further details.
- Static examples with error pages, redirects, injection etc may also be applied to dynamic apps.
- For the best latency & cold start time set `.lambda.memory` in up.json to 1536
- All examples use the `.name` "app" so you don't have to provision the stack each time
